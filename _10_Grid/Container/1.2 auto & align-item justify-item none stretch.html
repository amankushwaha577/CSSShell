    <h1>CSS Grid Stretching Example</h1>
    <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="item">Short</div>
        <div class="item">A bit longer item</div>
        <div class="item">Item 3</div>
        <div class="item">Another long item that might stretch the column</div>
    </div>

</body>
</html>


<!-- 
In this case:
Stretching Behavior: Each item will stretch vertically to fill the 100px height of the grid row, despite their content varying in height.
Full Use of Space: The items will also expand horizontally to fill their respective grid columns if the auto value allows it.
1. We have used grid-template-rows: 100px; 
   So here every row will have maximum height of 100px;
   total width of container is 600px.

2. Here we are using 
   align-items: start; /* To Prevent vertical stretching : Now item will not take complete row height they will take only whatever needed for content*/ 
   justify-items: start; /* To Prevent horizontal stretching : Now item will not take complete column width they will take only whatever needed for content*/
 -->


<!-- 
 
 One More thing to note : 
  1. When we give auto to columns than
        column occupies space that is required for its content + container distribute it some available proportional space.

        +  here thing need to not that if we give align-items: start; to item than
        it will not stretch to occupy full width of column it will just take that is required for its inner content. 
        space will remain in column in this case

  2. When we give auto to row than
        row only occupies space that is required for its content..

        +  here thing need to not that if we give justify-items: start; to item than
        it will not stretch to occupy full height of its row. it will just take height that is required for its inner content. 
        space will remain in row in this case
