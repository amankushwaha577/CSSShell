<!-- 
When their is no z-index on positioned element(relative/absolute). 
than their stacking order is determined by their order in the DOM.

.box1 with position: relative and no z-index does not create a stacking context.
.box2 with position: absolute and no z-index does not create a stacking context either.
Since neither element has a stacking context, their stacking order is determined by their order in the DOM, 
and they are still part of the stacking context created by the root element (or a parent with z-index if it existed).
