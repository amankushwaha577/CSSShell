<!-- 
1. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) :
--------------------------------
Definition: CSS is the standard language used to style HTML documents. 
            It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of web pages.

Syntax: CSS uses a straightforward syntax with selectors and declarations. 

Example:
body {
    color: white;
}

Features: CSS has evolved over time to include features like Flexbox and Grid layouts, animations, and transitions.
disadvatages :  It lacks advanced functionalities like variables, nesting, and mixins.



2. SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) :
---------------------------------------------
Definition: SASS is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS. It allows for more dynamic styling capabilities.
Syntax: SASS can be written in two syntaxes:

A. Indented Syntax: This uses indentation instead of curly braces and semicolons, making it less verbose. 
Example :
body
  background-color: blue
  color: white

B. SCSS (Sassy CSS): This is the more popular syntax of SASS that uses curly braces and semicolons, making it look more like standard CSS.
Example :
body {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}

Features: SASS provides variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and functions, allowing for more organized and reusable code.




Summary
1. CSS: The standard styling language to style HTML documents, limited in functionality.
2. SASS: A powerful preprocessor scripting language that offers two syntaxes (Indented and SCSS) and advanced features for writing styles.
3. SCSS: A syntax of SASS that is more CSS-like and widely used, allowing for easier integration with existing CSS.

In practice, developers often prefer SCSS because it combines the best of both worlds—familiarity and enhanced functionality.
