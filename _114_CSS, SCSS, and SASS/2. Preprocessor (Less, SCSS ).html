📌 What is a CSS Preprocessor?

A **CSS preprocessor** is a tool that extends CSS with **programming features** like variables, nesting, mixin, functions, and loops. 

SCSS (Sassy CSS):  
- 🧑‍💻 SCSS is synatx of SASS, That is preprocessor scripting language.
- 🛠️ Adds powerful features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more.
- ✅ SCSS uses curly braces `{}` and semicolons `;` like traditional CSS.

LESS (Leaner Style Sheets) :  
- 🧑‍💻 LESS is a CSS preprocessor with similar features to SCSS, such as variables, nesting, and mixins.
- ✅ LESS uses `@` for variables instead of `$` (like in SCSS).
- 🎨 LESS also allows for **functions** and **mathematical operations** in your CSS, but with a slightly different syntax compared to SCSS.

SASS IS WRITTEN IN RUBY, less IS WRITTEN JAVASCRIPT.

🔹 Plain CSS:  
- 🚫 Plain CSS is the standard style sheet language used by browsers, without any preprocessor features.
- ✅ No variables, nesting, or mixins. Everything must be written directly in the stylesheet.

| Feature         | SCSS                       | LESS                       | Plain CSS              |
|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Variables       | `$variable: value;`         | `@variable: value;`         | 🚫 No variables         |
| Nesting         | ✅ Supports nesting         | ✅ Supports nesting         | 🚫 No nesting           |
| Mixins          | ✅ Supports mixins          | ✅ Supports mixins          | 🚫 No mixins            |

| Syntax          | `{}` with semicolons       | `{}` with semicolons       | `{}` with semicolons   |

🎯 **Why use a preprocessor?**  
1. **Modularity**: Makes your code more **organized** and **modular**.
2. **Reusability**: Allows for **mixins**, **functions**, and **variables** to avoid repetitive code.
3. **Maintainability**: Improves readability and makes large projects easier to manage.
