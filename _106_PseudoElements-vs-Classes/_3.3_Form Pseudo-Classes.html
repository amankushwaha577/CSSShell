<!-- 
The input:focus style should work to change the border color of an input field when it is focused
(i.e., when a user clicks into the input field). If it's not working, it could be due to various reasons,
such as browser default styles or conflicting styles.
 -->

<!-- 
The input:focus rule changes the border of the input field to blue when it is focused.
The outline: none; removes the default browser focus outline, making the blue border more prominent.

Mean whatever you see outside input actually is outline not border.
So  you can also write lik this :

input:focus {
    outline: 2px solid blue; /* Blue outline when input is focused */
}

It will work !
