<!-- 
justify-content → Aligns the ENTIRE grid (all columns + gaps) HORIZONTALLY inside the container.
Only works when : when the grid’s total width is smaller than the container's width.

Here grid = 3 columns × 2 rows = 6 items.

Correct grid representation:
-------------------------------
Row 1: 🟦 🟦 🟦
Row 2: 🟦 🟦 🟦

Values:
--------------------------------------------------

1. justify-content: start (default) → Grid sticks LEFT
   |🟦 🟦 🟦          |
   |🟦 🟦 🟦          |

2. justify-content: end → Grid sticks RIGHT
   |          🟦 🟦 🟦|
   |          🟦 🟦 🟦|

3. justify-content: center → Grid centered
   |     🟦 🟦 🟦     |
   |     🟦 🟦 🟦     |

4. justify-content: stretch → Grid stretches tracks to fill width
   |🟦   🟦   🟦|
   |🟦   🟦   🟦|
   ⚠️ Only works if tracks are flexible (fr units).
   With fixed px → behaves like start.

5. justify-content: space-between → Equal space BETWEEN columns, none at edges
    space-between (E = 0, between = B)
    |[🟦]······[🟦]······[🟦]|   ← Row 1
    |[🟦]······[🟦]······[🟦]|   ← Row 2

6. justify-content: space-around → Equal space AROUND each column  
    space-around (E = B/2) |     (Edge space ≈ half of the between-gap)
    |··[🟦]······[🟦]······[🟦]··|   ← Row 1
    |··[🟦]······[🟦]······[🟦]··|   ← Row 2


7. justify-content: space-evenly → Equal space EVERYWHERE (edges & between)
    space-evenly (E = B) |     (All gaps (edges + between) are equal)
    |···[🟦]···[🟦]···[🟦]···|   ← Row 1
    |···[🟦]···[🟦]···[🟦]···|   ← Row 2

<!-- 
In CSS Grid, justify-content aligns the entire grid horizontally within container, 


Note :This property is useful when you want to position the grid itself, not individual items within the grid.

justify-content: <alignment>;
----------------------------
1. start(default): Aligns the grid to the start (left) of the container.
2. end:            Aligns the grid to the end (right) of the container.
3. center:         Aligns the grid to the end (right) of the container.| horizontally

4. stretch: Stretches the grid to fill the entire width of the container.
            If column width is already defined than it will not work. it act as justify-content: start

5. space-between: Distributes equal space between each track(column track), with no space at the edges.
6. space-around:  Distributes equal space around  each track(column track), with half-size space on the edges.
7. space-evenly:  Distributes equal space between+around each track(column track), including at the edges.

<!-- 
 In CSS Grid, when we refer to the "entire grid," we're talking about the whole structure created 
 by the grid container, which includes all of the defined rows, columns, and gaps between grid items.
