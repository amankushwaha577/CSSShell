<!-- 
The grid-template-rows property in CSS is used to define the row structure within a CSS Grid container, 
setting the number and height of rows. This property gives precise control over the layout and distribution of rows within a grid, 
enabling the creation of responsive and flexible layouts.

grid-template-rows: row-size1 row-size2 row-size3 ...;



-------------------------------------------------
Common Units and Functions for grid-template-rows  :
_________________________________________________

1. Fixed Size (e.g., px, em, %)
-------------------------------
Defines rows with a fixed height.

Example: A). grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; 
         -----------------------------------
         creates two rows, the first with a height of 100px and the second 200px.

         .grid-container {
                display: grid;
                grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
          }

          B). grid-template-rows: 500px auto;
          ----------------------------------
          The first row remains fixed at 500px. 
          Second row fits content automatically + if height of container is fixed and some remainining space of height there than space will
          be distributed to this auto.

          .grid-container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-rows: 500px auto; 
           }
        
          C). First Row: 500px (explicitly defined).
             Second Row: auto (expands to fit content only).
             Third Row and Beyond: 100px each (applies to any rows created implicitly by the grid).
             -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          .grid-container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-rows: 500px auto; /* First row: 500px, second row: auto */
            grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* Any additional rows: 100px */
          }

2.auto
------------------------------------------------------------
Sets the row height based on its content, adjusting dynamically.
simply = take height of content + if height of container is fixed and some remainining space of height there than space will 
                                  be distributed to this auto.

Example: grid-template-rows: auto auto; 
         creates two rows, each automatically adjusting its height to fit its (content + distributed space from container).

                            .grid-container {
                              display: grid;
                              grid-template-rows: auto auto;
                            }
 -->

<!-- _______________________________________________________________________________________________ -->

<!-- 
In this case:
Stretching Behavior: Each item will stretch vertically to fill the 100px height of the grid row, despite their content varying in height.
Full Use of Space: The items will also expand horizontally to fill their respective grid columns if the auto value allows it.
1. We have used grid-template-rows: 100px; 
   So here 1st row will have  height of 100px;

   grid-auto-rows: 200px;
   2nd Row, and other rows will be of 200px.
   total width of container is 600px.

   Note : if suppose 1st Row (100Px) + 3 More Row(3 x 200px = 600px)
          than Rows will break container height (ie 600px) 
          container will remain 600px but addional rows look like they broken outside container.

2. Here we are using 
   align-items: start; /* To Prevent vertical stretching : Now item will not take complete row height they will take only whatever needed for content*/ 
   justify-items: start; /* To Prevent horizontal stretching : Now item will not take complete column width they will take only whatever needed for content*/
 -->

<!-- 
 
 One More thing to note : 
  1. When we give auto to columns than
        column occupies space that is required for its content + container distribute it some available proportional space.

        +  here thing need to not that if we give align-items: start; to item than
        it will not stretch to occupy full width of column it will just take that is required for its inner content. 
        space will remain in column in this case

  2. When we give auto to row than
        row only occupies space that is required for its content..

        +  here thing need to not that if we give justify-items: start; to item than
        it will not stretch to occupy full height of its row. it will just take height that is required for its inner content. 
        space will remain in row in this case
