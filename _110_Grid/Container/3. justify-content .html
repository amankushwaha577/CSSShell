<!-- 
In CSS Grid, justify-content controls the horizontal alignment of the entire grid within the grid container, 
when the gridâ€™s total width is smaller than the container's width. This property is useful when you want to position 
the grid itself, not individual items within the grid.

justify-content: <alignment>;

Possible Values
1. start: Aligns the grid to the start (left) of the container.
2. end: Aligns the grid to the end (right) of the container.
3. center: Centers the grid horizontally within the container.
4. stretch: Stretches the grid to fill the entire width of the container.
5. space-between: Distributes extra space evenly between the grid tracks, with no space at the edges.
6. space-around: Distributes extra space evenly around each track, with half-size space on the edges.
7. space-evenly: Distributes extra space evenly, including at the edges.

 <!-- 
 In CSS Grid, when we refer to the "entire grid," we're talking about the whole structure created 
 by the grid container, which includes all of the defined rows, columns, and gaps between grid items. 
 This grid structure is what holds and organizes the individual grid items.
