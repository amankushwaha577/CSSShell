<!-- 
The grid-template-rows property in CSS is used to define the number and height of rows within a CSS Grid container, 

grid-template-rows: row-size1 row-size2 row-size3 ...;

Common Units and Functions for grid-template-rows  :
---------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed Size (e.g., px, em, %) :-
-------------------------------
Defines rows with a fixed height.

Example: A). grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; 
         -----------------------------------
         creates two rows, the first with a height of 100px and the second 200px.

         .grid-container {
                display: grid;
                grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
          }

          B). grid-template-rows: 500px auto;
          ----------------------------------
          The first row remains fixed at 500px. 
          Second row fits content automatically + if height of container is fixed and some remainining space of height there than space will
          be distributed to this auto.

        
          C). grid-template-rows: 500px auto;
              grid-auto-rows: 100px;
             -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             First Row: 500px (explicitly defined).
             Second Row: auto (expands to fit content only + if additional space there in container height it will be distributed to this auto.).
             Third Row and Beyond: 100px each (applies to any rows created implicitly by the grid).


2.auto
------------------------------------------------------------
Sets the row height based on its content, adjusting dynamically.
simply = take height of content + if height of container is fixed and some remainining space of height there than space will 
                                  be distributed to this auto.

Example: grid-template-rows: auto auto; 
         creates two rows, each automatically adjusting its height to fit its (content + distributed space from container).

                            .grid-container {
                              display: grid;
                              grid-template-rows: auto auto;
                            }
 -->


<!-- 
Few Notes :
if suppose 1st Row (100Px) + 3 More Row(3 x 200px = 600px)
   than Rows will break container height (ie 500px) 
   container will remain 500px but addional rows look like they broken outside container.
-->


 <!-- 
Here we can use to prevent defualt behaviour 
-------------------------------------------
   align-items: start;   /* To Prevent vertical stretching   : Now item will not take complete row height they will take only whatever needed for content*/ 
   justify-items: start; /* To Prevent horizontal stretching : Now item will not take complete column width they will take only whatever needed for content*/
 
  1. When we give auto to columns than
        column occupies space that is required for its content + container distribute it some available proportional space.

        +  here thing need to not that if we give  justify-items: start; to item than
        items will not stretch to occupy full width of column it will just take that is required for its inner content. 
        some space will remain in column in this case

  2. When we give auto to row than
        row only occupies space that is required for its content. + if height of container is fixed
                                                                    than container distribute it some available proportional space in height too.

        +  here thing need to not that if we give align-items: start; to item than
        items will not stretch to occupy full height of its row. it will just take height that is required for its inner content. 
        some space will remain in row in this case
