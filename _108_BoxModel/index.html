    .box {
      width: 200px;
      height: 100px;
      padding: 20px;             /* Adds 20px of space inside the box */
      border: 5px solid blue;  /* Adds a 5px border around the box */
      margin: 15px;              /* Adds 15px of space outside the box */
      background-color: lightgray; 
      /* Total Box Width and Height Calculation
         box-sizing: content-box; (By Default) || Width and height include only the content.
         ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         The total overall width and height of an element is calculated by adding the content, padding, and border dimensions. For the example above:
         Width: 200px (content) + 20px * 2 (padding) + 5px * 2 (border) = 250px
         Height: 100px (content) + 20px * 2 (padding) + 5px * 2 (border) = 150px 

         So the visible box area is 250px x 150px, even though the width and height of the content are set to 200px and 100px.

         Note : The left and right margins would add 15px on each side, but they would not alter the total width and height of the box itself.

    .bbox{
        box-sizing: border-box;
        /*
        box-sizing Property
        To make layout sizing easier, you can use the box-sizing property. The two main values are:

        content-box (default): Width and height include only the content; 
                               padding, borders, and margins are not included.
        border-box: Width and height include content, padding and border, simplifying layout calculations. 

        With border-box, you get a more predictable layout, as width and height represent the total dimensions, 
        including padding and border.

 <!-- 
The box model treats every HTML element as a rectangular box consisting of content, padding, border, and margin.

1. Content
This is the actual "content" area where text, images, or other content of the element is displayed.
by default, The width and height applies on this content area only. || box-sizing: content-box; (default)
For example, if you set width: 200px and height: 100px on an element, it only affects the content area.

2. Padding
Padding is the space between the content and the border of the element.
You can set padding on all sides (padding), or each side individually (padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left).
Padding adds space inside the element but does not change the content area's dimensions.

3. Border
The border surrounds the padding and content.
You can specify the border's width, style, and color (e.g., border: 1px solid black).
Like padding, the border increases the element's overall size and makes it visually distinct from neighboring elements.

4. Margin
Margin is the space outside the border, separating the element from adjacent elements.
It does not visually affect the element’s size but influences its position relative to other elements.
You can set margins on all sides (margin) or each side individually (margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left).
Margin can also collapse between elements (e.g., if two elements with top and bottom margins touch, only the larger margin is applied).
