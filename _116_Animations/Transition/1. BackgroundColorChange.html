ðŸ”¹ **CSS Transitions**:  
------------------------
1. Transition is used to change an element's property value **over a specified duration** 
   when a triggering event occurs (like hover, focus, or active states). 
2. Itâ€™s like a **smooth change** between two states when an action occurs.

        selector {
            transition: property duration timing-function delay;
        } 

A. property: Property to animate [opacity, background-color, transform].
B. duration: Time in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms) for the transition.

C. timing-function: Defines the transition speed curve [ ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out ].
                    a). linear :	 Moves at a constant speed.
                    b). ease-in:     Starts slow, then speeds up.
                    c). ease-out:	 Starts fast, then slows down.
                    d). ease   :     Starts slow, speeds up, then slows down. (Default)
                    e). ease-in-out: Starts slow, speeds up, and slows down again.

D. delay (optional): Time before the transition starts.


Note : ðŸŽ¨ Transitions are **easier to set up** than animations, but they are limited to **two states** (starting and ending).
