📌 Understanding the `background-size` Property in CSS:

The `background-size` property in CSS is used to control the size of the background image. It has several values like **contain**, **cover**, and **fill** that determine how the image is scaled.

🔹 **contain**:  
- 🖼️ When you want to make sure the **entire image** is visible, even if it doesn't fill the container completely (e.g., logos, icons).
- ✅ The entire image will be visible, but there might be **empty space** around it (if the aspect ratio of the image doesn’t match the element’s aspect ratio).
  
🔹 **cover**:  
- 🖼️  When you need the background image to **completely cover** the area, while maintaining its aspect ratio. 
- ✅  Some parts of the image may be **cropped** if the aspect ratio of the element doesn’t match the image, but the image will completely cover the area.

🔹 **fill**:  
- 🖼️ The image is **stretched** to **fill** the entire element, even if it means distorting its aspect ratio. 
- ✅ No empty space is left, but the image **may be distorted** to fit the container.
