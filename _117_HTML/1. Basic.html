Q0. What is the DOCTYPE in HTML?
Ans.The DOCTYPE declaration defines the document type and HTML version. Example:
    <!DOCTYPE html>  (This is for HTML5)

Q1.  What is HTML?
Ans. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. 
     It provides structure to web content using elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

Q2.  What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?   
Ans Feature            | HTML                     | XHTML
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Case Sensitivity   | Not case-sensitive       | Case-sensitive
    Syntax             | Less strict              | Strict rules
    Closing Tags       | Optional in some cases   | Mandatory

Q3. What are HTML tags?
Ans.Tags are used to create elements.  Tags use the symbols < and > to set them apart from the HTML content.
    Example: <p> and </p> are paragraph tags.
    The HTML tags need not always be closed. For example, in the case of images, the closing tags are not required as <img> tags.

Q4.  Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
Ans. No, HTML tags define the structure of a web page, while HTML elements are made up of a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page.

Q5. What is an element in HTML?  
Ans.✅ An element in HTML is a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page.  
    ✅ It consists of:  
       - A start tag  
       - Content  
       - An end tag  

    ✨ Example:  
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>  

    🔥 Elements help structure and organize web content!  

Q6. What is the difference between block-level and inline elements?
Ans. Block-level elements: Take up the full width of the container.
     Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <section>, <article>.
    
     Inline elements: Take up only as much width as necessary.
     Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>.

Q7. What are HTML Attributes?         
Ans.✅ Attributes are properties that can be added to an HTML tag.  
    ✅ They change the way the tag behaves or is displayed.  

    ✨ Example:  
    - The <img> tag has an `src` attribute, which defines the image source:  
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image">  

    📌 Attributes must be added:  
    - Right after the name of the HTML tag inside the brackets.  
    - Only in opening or self-closing tags, never in closing tags!  

Q8. What is a marquee in HTML?
Ans.Marquee is used for scrolling text on a web page. It automatically scrolls the image or text up, down, left, or right. You must use </marquee> tags to apply for a marquee.


Q9. What is the difference between semantic and non-semantic HTML?  
Ans.✅ **Semantic HTML** refers to HTML elements that carry meaning about the content they contain, providing context and structure to both browsers and developers.  
    ✅ These elements clearly define their role and are crucial for improving accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and overall web content understanding.  
    ✅ **Non-Semantic HTML** elements, on the other hand, do not convey specific meaning about their content. They are typically used for layout and styling purposes without providing any additional context to the content they wrap.  

    ✨ **Professional Example:**

    ✅ **Semantic Elements:**  
        - **Advantages:**  
         - Improves SEO by making it easier for search engines to understand page structure.  
         - Enhances accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies.  
         - Makes the code easier to read and maintain.  

    ✅ **Non-Semantic Elements:**  
       - `<div>`, `<span>`  
       - These elements provide no semantic value and are generally used for styling and grouping content.  
       - **Disadvantages:**  
         - Non-semantic tags may make it more difficult for search engines to index content effectively.  
         - Can lead to cluttered and harder-to-maintain code, as they don’t offer descriptive context.  

    🔥 In summary, using semantic HTML elements is a best practice for writing clean, accessible, and SEO-friendly code. It is an essential step in creating modern, professional web applications.


Q10. How do you separate a section of text in HTML?
Ans. We separate a section of text in HTML using the below tags:
        Ex:
        <br> tag – It separates the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.
        <p> tag–This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.
        <blockquote> tag–This tag defines large quoted sections.

11. What is the difference between HTML and CSS?
Ans.HTML creates a web page's structure and content, while CSS defines its appearance and layout.


Q12. What are void elements in HTML?  
Ans. ✅ **Void elements** in HTML are tags that do not require a closing tag.  
     ✅ These elements are self-contained and do not have any nested content, meaning they only need an opening tag.  
     ✅ Void elements are commonly used to insert images, line breaks, or other content that doesn't need additional information.  

    ✨ **Examples of Void Elements:**  
    - `<img>`: Used to display images.  
    - `<br>`: Represents a line break.  
    - `<hr>`: Represents a horizontal rule or divider.  
    - `<input>`: Used in forms to gather user input.  
    - `<meta>`: Provides metadata about the HTML document.

    🔥 Void elements simplify HTML by reducing the need for closing tags and are crucial for certain types of content!  

 
Q13. What is the advantage of collapsing white space?  
Ans. ✅ **Collapsing white space** in HTML refers to the practice of removing unnecessary white space between HTML elements.  
     ✅ It helps in reducing the size of the web page and optimizing performance.  

     ✅ Advantages:  
        - **Reduces page size:** Unnecessary white spaces, such as extra spaces, tabs, and newlines, can be removed, reducing the overall size of the HTML file.  
        - **Improves loading speed:** Smaller file size leads to faster page loading times, which enhances the user experience.  
        - **Better performance:** Especially important for mobile devices or slower connections.  

    ✨ Example:  
    - Before collapsing white space:  
    ```html  
    <h1>    Hello    World    </h1>  
    <p>    This    is    a    paragraph.    </p>  
    ```  
    - After collapsing white space:  
    ```html  
    <h1>Hello World</h1>  
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>  
    ```  

    🔥 Collapsing white space keeps the web page lightweight, faster, and more efficient!  


Q14. What are HTML Entities?  
Ans. ✅ **HTML Entities** are special characters used to represent characters that cannot be typed directly on a keyboard.  
     ✅ HTML entities are written using the ampersand `&` symbol + entity name or number + semicolon `;`.  
        - **Named entities**: Use a name for the character, e.g., `&amp;` for `&`  
        - **Numeric entities**: Use a number corresponding to the character in Unicode, e.g., `&#169;` for ©.  

    ✨ **Examples of HTML Entities:**  
    - `&amp;` → `&` (ampersand)   
    - `&#169;` → © (copyright symbol)  


15. How do we insert a comment in HTML?
    We can insert a comment in HTML by beginning with a lesser than sign and ending with a greater than sign. 
    For example, “<!-“ and “->

 
Q16. How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?  
Ans.    ✅ **Hyperlinks** in HTML are created using the `<a>` (anchor) tag.  
        ✅ They allow users to navigate from one page to another.  
        ✅ Hyperlinks can be added to text, images, or other elements.  

    ✨ **Syntax:**  
    ```html
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Click Here</a>
    ```  
    - `href`: Specifies the URL of the destination page.  
    - `target="_blank"`: Opens the link in a new tab.  

    ✨ **Example:**  
    ```html
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Visit Google</a>
    ```  
    - This link opens Google in a new tab.  

    ✨ **Adding a hyperlink to an image:**  
    ```html
    <a href="https://www.example.com">
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image">
    </a>
    ```  
    - Clicking on the image will open the specified link.  

    🔥 Hyperlinks are essential for navigation and connecting web pages!
