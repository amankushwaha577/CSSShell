Q1. What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?  || What are the significant goals of the HTML5 specification?
Ans. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Multimedia Support :
        - **HTML**: Requires third-party plugins (like Flash) for audio and video.  
        - **HTML5**: Supports native multimedia elements: `<audio>` and `<video>`.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```html
    <video controls>
      <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **2Ô∏è‚É£ Improved Semantics**  
        - **HTML**: Uses `<div>` for structuring content.  
        - **HTML5**: Introduces semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```html
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>This is a blog post.</p>
    </article>
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **3Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile Optimization & Responsiveness**  
        - **HTML**: Lacks direct support for mobile-friendly development.  
        - **HTML5**: Introduces the `<meta viewport>` tag for responsive design.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **4Ô∏è‚É£ Form Enhancements**  
        - **HTML**: Requires JavaScript for validation and advanced input types.  
        - **HTML5**: Introduces new input types like `email`, `date`, `number`, etc.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```html
    <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **5Ô∏è‚É£ Local Storage & Caching**  
        - **HTML**: Uses cookies for storing user data.  
        - **HTML5**: Introduces `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for better performance.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```js
    localStorage.setItem("username", "JohnDoe");
    console.log(localStorage.getItem("username")); // Output: JohnDoe
    ```  

    üî• **Conclusion:**  
        - **HTML5** enhances web development with built-in multimedia, semantic elements, mobile support, and better storage options.  
        - It eliminates the need for third-party plugins, making web pages faster and more efficient.

Q2 . Explain the concept of web storage in HTML5.  
Ans. ‚úÖ HTML5 introduced **Web Storage** to store data locally on the user's browser, offering two types of storage:  
        - **SessionStorage**  
        - **LocalStorage**  

    ‚úÖ **SessionStorage:**  
        - Stores data for the duration of the **current session**.  
        - Data is cleared when the tab or window is closed.  
        - Data is **not** shared across tabs or windows.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**
    ```javascript
    sessionStorage.setItem("username", "JohnDoe");
    let username = sessionStorage.getItem("username");
    console.log(username); // Output: JohnDoe
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **LocalStorage:**  
        - Stores data with **no expiration date**.  
        - Data persists even after the browser is closed and re-opened.  
        - Data is **shared across tabs and windows** of the same origin.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**
    ```javascript
    localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
    let theme = localStorage.getItem("theme");
    console.log(theme); // Output: dark
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **Key Differences:**  
        - **SessionStorage** is session-based, whereas **LocalStorage** is persistent.  
        - **SessionStorage** clears automatically when the session ends (browser window/tab is closed).  
        - **LocalStorage** data stays until it is explicitly deleted or the user clears their browser cache.  

    üî• **Conclusion:**  
        - Web Storage provides a simple way to store data on the client-side, improving web application performance and user experience by avoiding repeated requests to the server.

Qu3. What is Microdata in HTML5?
Ans. Microdata in HTML5 is used to add structured data to web content to help search engines understand the context of the page better. 
     It uses special attributes like `itemscope`, `itemprop`, and `itemtype` to mark up information.
    
    Example:
    <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
        <span itemprop="name">John Doe</span>
        <span itemprop="jobTitle">Web Developer</span>
    </div>

    Benefits:
    - Helps search engines display more relevant information in search results (e.g., rich snippets).
    - Improves visibility in search results, but does not directly affect SEO ranking.

        ctx.fillStyle = "blue";
        ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);
    </script>
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **JPG or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):**  
        - A **compressed image format** widely used for **digital photography**.  
        - JPG files use **10:1 compression**, making them smaller in size, suitable for images where quality loss is minimal.  

    ‚úÖ **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**  
        - **CSS** is used to control the presentation of a web page, including its **layout**, **colors**, **fonts**, and **spacing**.  
        - CSS can also be used to style web graphics (e.g., background images) and to create animations and transitions for interactive visual effects.  

    üî• **Conclusion:**  
        - HTML5 Graphics provide a versatile range of tools and formats for creating rich, interactive, and visually appealing web content. Using technologies like **SVG**, **Canvas API**, and **CSS**, developers can enhance user experience through dynamic and scalable graphics.

Q6. What are Web Workers?  
Ans. ‚úÖ **Web Workers** are a mechanism in HTML5 that allows web content to run scripts in the background, in separate threads from the main UI thread.  
        - This means tasks can run without affecting the **user interface** or interrupting the user‚Äôs interaction with the page.  
        - Web Workers are especially useful for performing long-running or CPU-intensive tasks without freezing or slowing down the UI.  
        
    ‚úÖ **Key Features of Web Workers:**
        - **Background Thread Execution:** Web Workers run on a background thread, allowing the main thread (UI) to remain responsive.  
        - **Message Passing:** Workers can post messages to the main thread and vice versa using **postMessage()**. This allows communication between the worker and the main UI thread.  
        - **Network Requests:** Workers have access to the **XMLHttpRequest** and **fetch()** APIs, enabling them to perform network requests in the background.  
        - **Event Handlers:** Workers can send messages using event handlers, enabling the main thread to handle messages asynchronously.

    ‚ú® **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // Main Thread (UI)
    const worker = new Worker('worker.js');  // Create a Web Worker
    worker.onmessage = function(event) {
        console.log("Message from worker:", event.data);  // Handle message from worker
    };
    worker.postMessage("Start");  // Send message to worker

    // worker.js (Web Worker)
    onmessage = function(event) {
        // Do some heavy task here
        postMessage("Task completed");  // Send message back to main thread
    };
    ```  

    üî• **Benefits of Web Workers:**
        - **Improved User Experience:** Web Workers allow heavy computation tasks to be offloaded, keeping the UI smooth and responsive.  
        - **Non-blocking Operations:** They can handle intensive tasks like data processing, calculations, and file operations without blocking the user interface.

<!-- 
Q6. What are raster images and vector images?  
Ans.‚úÖ **Raster Images** are made up of **pixels**, which are tiny dots that together form an image.  
        - These images have fixed resolutions, and when zoomed in, individual pixels become visible as tiny squares.  
        - The number of pixels in a raster image determines its resolution. Higher pixel counts lead to **better quality** but also result in **larger file sizes**.  
        - Common raster image formats include **JPEG**, **PNG**, **GIF**, and **BMP**.  
        
    ‚úÖ **Vector Images** are made using **mathematical formulas** to create shapes like lines, curves, and polygons.  
        - Vector images do not rely on pixels, which means they can be **scaled infinitely** without losing quality.  
        - These images are **ideal for designs** like logos, icons, and illustrations that require scalability.  
        - Vector images are often used in **printing** and for **web graphics** that need to adjust to different screen sizes without degradation.
        
    ‚ú® **Example:**
    - **Raster Image:** A photograph of a person taken with a camera.
    - **Vector Image:** A logo made in Adobe Illustrator or a simple icon designed in SVG format.
    
    üî• **Key Differences:**
        - **Raster Images:** Great for complex images (photos) but lose quality when resized.
        - **Vector Images:** Perfect for simple designs and can be scaled up or down without loss of quality.

Q7. What is a manifest file in HTML5?  
Ans. ‚úÖ A manifest file is a text file that lists resources to be cached for offline use.  
        - It uses the syntax `CACHE MANIFEST`.  
        - Divided into 3 sections: **CACHE**, **NETWORK**, and **FALLBACK**.  
        - The `<html>` tag can include the `manifest` attribute to specify the file.

    ‚úÖ Example:
    ```html
    <html manifest="example.appcache">
    ```

    ‚ùó **Note:** The manifest file is now **deprecated** in HTML5 and replaced by **Service Workers** for offline caching.
