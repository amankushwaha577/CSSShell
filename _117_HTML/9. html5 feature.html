Q1. What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?  || What are the significant goals of the HTML5 specification?
Ans. ‚úÖ **HTML5** is the latest version of HTML and includes new features and improvements over previous versions.  
     ‚úÖ **Key Differences Between HTML and HTML5:**  

     ‚úÖ **1Ô∏è‚É£ Multimedia Support**  
        - **HTML**: Requires third-party plugins (like Flash) for audio and video.  
        - **HTML5**: Supports native multimedia elements: `<audio>` and `<video>`.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```html
    <video controls>
      <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **2Ô∏è‚É£ Improved Semantics**  
        - **HTML**: Uses `<div>` for structuring content.  
        - **HTML5**: Introduces semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```html
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>This is a blog post.</p>
    </article>
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **3Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile Optimization & Responsiveness**  
        - **HTML**: Lacks direct support for mobile-friendly development.  
        - **HTML5**: Introduces the `<meta viewport>` tag for responsive design.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **4Ô∏è‚É£ Form Enhancements**  
        - **HTML**: Requires JavaScript for validation and advanced input types.  
        - **HTML5**: Introduces new input types like `email`, `date`, `number`, etc.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```html
    <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **5Ô∏è‚É£ Local Storage & Caching**  
        - **HTML**: Uses cookies for storing user data.  
        - **HTML5**: Introduces `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for better performance.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**  
    ```js
    localStorage.setItem("username", "JohnDoe");
    console.log(localStorage.getItem("username")); // Output: JohnDoe
    ```  

    üî• **Conclusion:**  
        - **HTML5** enhances web development with built-in multimedia, semantic elements, mobile support, and better storage options.  
        - It eliminates the need for third-party plugins, making web pages faster and more efficient.

Q2 . Explain the concept of web storage in HTML5.  
Ans. ‚úÖ HTML5 introduced **Web Storage** to store data locally on the user's browser, offering two types of storage:  
        - **SessionStorage**  
        - **LocalStorage**  

    ‚úÖ **SessionStorage:**  
        - Stores data for the duration of the **current session**.  
        - Data is cleared when the tab or window is closed.  
        - Data is **not** shared across tabs or windows.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**
    ```javascript
    sessionStorage.setItem("username", "JohnDoe");
    let username = sessionStorage.getItem("username");
    console.log(username); // Output: JohnDoe
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **LocalStorage:**  
        - Stores data with **no expiration date**.  
        - Data persists even after the browser is closed and re-opened.  
        - Data is **shared across tabs and windows** of the same origin.  

    ‚ú® **Example:**
    ```javascript
    localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
    let theme = localStorage.getItem("theme");
    console.log(theme); // Output: dark
    ```  

    ‚úÖ **Key Differences:**  
        - **SessionStorage** is session-based, whereas **LocalStorage** is persistent.  
        - **SessionStorage** clears automatically when the session ends (browser window/tab is closed).  
        - **LocalStorage** data stays until it is explicitly deleted or the user clears their browser cache.  

    üî• **Conclusion:**  
        - Web Storage provides a simple way to store data on the client-side, improving web application performance and user experience by avoiding repeated requests to the server.

Qu3. What is Microdata in HTML5?
Ans. Microdata in HTML5 is used to add structured data to web content to help search engines understand the context of the page better. 
     It uses special attributes like `itemscope`, `itemprop`, and `itemtype` to mark up information.
    
    Example:
    <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
        <span itemprop="name">John Doe</span>
        <span itemprop="jobTitle">Web Developer</span>
    </div>

    Benefits:
    - Helps search engines display more relevant information in search results (e.g., rich snippets).
    - Improves visibility in search results, but does not directly affect SEO ranking.
