    Q25. What is SVG in HTML?  
    Ans. âœ… **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)** is an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics.  
        âœ… It is used to create images, animations, and interactive graphics without losing quality when resized.  
        âœ… Unlike raster images (JPEG, PNG), **SVG images are resolution-independent** and scale perfectly.  

    âœ¨ **Key Features of SVG:**  
    - Scalable without losing quality  
    - Supports animations and interactions  
    - Editable using CSS and JavaScript  
    - Lightweight compared to traditional image formats  

    âœ¨ **Example:**  
    ```html
    <svg width="200" height="200">
        <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
    </svg>
    ```
    - `<svg>`: Defines the SVG container.  
    - `<circle>`: Creates a red circle with a black border.  
    - `cx`, `cy`: Defines the circle's center position.  
    - `r`: Radius of the circle.  
    - `stroke`: Outline color, `fill`: Inner color.  

    ðŸ”¥ **Use Case:** SVG is widely used for **icons, charts, infographics, and responsive UI designs**!
