<!-- 
1. position: relative; 
----------------------
The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. 
If you add offsets (top, left, right, bottom), it will move relative to where it would normally be, 
but the space it originally occupies is preserved. 


Stacking Context:
--------------------
1. When an element is set to position: relative | absolute | fixed | sticky and has a z-index explicitly applied,
   (If z-index is not auto) ðŸŒ³.
   it creates a new stacking context .
   Ex -> position: relative; z-index: 10; /* New stacking context */

   Note : An element with position: relative | absolute | fixed | sticky and a z-index : auto will never create Stacking context.

2. Opacity < 1 Creates Stacking Context ðŸŒ€:
   Elements with opacity less than 1 automatically create a new stacking context

   opacity: 0.9; /* New stacking context */

3. CSS Transforms, Filters, and Effects Create Stacking Context ðŸŽ¨:
   Elements with transform, filter, perspective, or clip-path create a stacking context

   transform: scale(1); /* New stacking context */
   filter: blur(5px); /* New stacking context */

4. Overflow Hidden/Scroll Creates Stacking Context ðŸš§:
   Elements with overflow set to hidden/ scroll/ or auto and a position other than static create a stacking context.

   position: relative;
   overflow: hidden; /* New stacking context */






When two elements are in the same stacking context, their stacking order is determined by their source order in the HTML.
The box2 appears later in the document, so it is painted on top of the box1.
