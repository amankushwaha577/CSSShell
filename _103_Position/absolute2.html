<!-- If no positioned ancestor is found, it is positioned relative to the document (browser window).  -->

<!-- 

1. Behavior of .absolute-element:
        Since no ancestor has position: relative;, absolute;, or fixed;, the .absolute-element positions itself relative
        to the initial containing block, which is the <html> element (equivalent to the viewport for practical purposes).
        top: 50px; and left: 100px; place the element 50px from the top and 100px from the left of the viewport.
        
2. Other Content:
        The normal-flow div remains in the regular document flow and is unaffected by the absolute element,
        as the latter does not occupy any space in the flow.
