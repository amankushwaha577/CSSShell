<!-- 
4. Sticky Positioning
The Sticky element toggles between relative and fixed positioning on the bases of the user's scroll. 
It behaves like a relative element until a specific scroll position is reached, after which it behaves like a fixed element.

** It Affects layout until it becomes sticky.
 -->

<!-- 
**No, a sticky positioned element is not removed from the normal document flow:**.
A.Relative State when it is relatve - It occupies space in the layout.
B.Sticky state when it is sticky - It will not remove itself from layout document it will just float above elements its space 
                                   will be preserved. Which means other element will not occupy this space.
                                   It can toggle back on its space.
