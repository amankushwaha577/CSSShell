<!-- 
4. Sticky Positioning
The element toggles between relative and fixed positioning based on the user's scroll position. 
It behaves like a relative element until a specific scroll position is reached, after which it behaves like a fixed element.

** It Affects layout until it becomes sticky.
 -->

<!-- 
**No, a sticky positioned element is not removed from the normal document flow:**.
A.Relative State when it is relatve - It occupies space in the layout.
B.Sticky state when it is sticky - It will not remove itself from layout document it will just float above elements its space 
                                   will be preserved. Which means other element will not occupy this space.
