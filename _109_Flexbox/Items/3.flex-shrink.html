<!-- 
The flex-shrink property determines how a flex item should shrink *Relative (Proportially)* to other items in the main axis.
when the *space* is insufficient to accommodate all items at their defined sizes. 

flex-shrink: <number>;
<number>: A non-negative integer that serves as the shrink factor.

flex-shrink: 0 -> The item will not shrink at all.
flex-shrink: 1 -> (default): The item shrinks proportionally with other items when space is tight.
Greater than 1:-> The item will shrink more than an item with a flex-shrink value of 1.


Note: Key Points to Remember :
-------------------------------
 1. You might observed that every flex item shrinks when we change screen size, 
    It is just because every flex item have flex-shrink: 1 by default

 2. Incompatibility with flex-basis: If an item has a fixed width or height set (like width: 100px;), 
    and flex-shrink is set to a non-zero value, the item can still shrink beyond that fixed size unless its minimum size 
    is enforced with min-width or min-height.
