<!-- 
The flex-shrink property in CSS is used to control how a flex item will shrink relative to other items in the flex container 
when the **space** is insufficient to accommodate all items at their defined sizes. 
This property is crucial for managing how elements behave when the container is resized or when there is limited space.

flex-shrink: <number>;
<number>: A non-negative integer that serves as the shrink factor.

0: The item will not shrink at all, regardless of the available space.
1 (default): The item will shrink proportionally to other items with a positive flex-shrink value when space is limited.
Greater than 1: The item will shrink more than an item with a flex-shrink value of 1.
 -->

 <!-- 
 Note: Key Points to Remember :

 1. You might observed that every flex item shrinks when we change screen size, 
 It is just because every flex item have flex-shrink: 1 by default

 2.Incompatibility with Flex Basis: If an item has a fixed width or height set (like width: 100px;), 
 and flex-shrink is set to a non-zero value, the item can still shrink beyond that fixed size unless its minimum size 
 is enforced with min-width or min-height.

 3. Use Cases: Very useful in grid layouts, navigation bars, and responsive designs where space is a concern.
