<!-- 
It just distribute extra space among all flex items. Nothing else.....

The flex-grow property in CSS is used to control how much a flex item will grow relative to other items within the same flex container.
If there's ****extra space**** in the flex container, flex-grow determines how that space is distributed among the flex items.

flex-grow: <number>;
 -->

<!-- 
<number>: Any non-negative number. It specifies the "flex growth factor" or the relative proportion of space an item should take.
0 (default): The item will not grow to fill the remaining space.
1 or higher: The item will grow to fill the container. If multiple items have different flex-grow values, they will grow relative to each other based on their flex-grow factors.

For instance:
flex-grow: 1: The item will grow to take up space relative to other items also set to grow.
flex-grow: 2: The item will grow twice as much as an item with flex-grow: 1.

<!-- 
 1. What flex-grow Really Does
flex-grow specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to other items when there’s extra space in the container.
If all items have flex-grow: 0, they won’t expand, and extra space will remain unused.
If items have different flex-grow values, each item will take up space proportional to its flex-grow factor. 
For example, an item with flex-grow: 2 will take up twice as much additional space as an item with flex-grow: 1.
