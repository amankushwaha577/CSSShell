<!--
The flex-grow property controls how flex items grow when thereâ€™s extra space in the container(in main axis). 
It distributes that extra space proportionally based on the values you set for each item.

flex-grow: <number>;
<number>: Any non-negative number. It specifies the "flex growth factor" or the relative proportion of space an item should take.


flex-grow only affects the main axis.
-------------------------------------
1. Main Axis: This is the axis defined by flex-direction (default is row, from left to right).
   If you have extra space along the main axis, flex-grow will cause the items to stretch and grow horizontally (in a row-based layout, for example).

2.Cross Axis: The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis (vertical if the main axis is row, and horizontal if the main axis is column).
   Flex items do not grow along the cross axis using flex-grow. They might stretch to fill the cross axis (with the default align-items: stretch property), 
 
   
Examples
---------------------------------
1. flex-grow: 0 ( default )
   flex items will not grow to take up any extra space in the container. They will only take up as much space as their content or defined size, 
   So, if all items have flex-grow: 0, they won't stretch to fill any extra space in the container.

2. If all items have flex-grow: 1, they will grow equally.

3. If one item has flex-grow: 2 and the others have flex-grow: 1, that item will take up twice as much of the extra space.
