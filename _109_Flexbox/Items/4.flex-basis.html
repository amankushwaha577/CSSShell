<h1>The flex-basis Property</h1>

<p>Set the initial length of the third flex item to 200 pixels:</p>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div style="flex-basis:200px; flex-grow: 9;">3</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>


<!-- 
The flex-basis property is used sets the initial size of a flex item before space is distributed according to flex-grow and flex-shrink in main axis.

flex-basis: <length> | auto;

1. <length>: Specifies a fixed size for the flex item (e.g., 20px, 50%, 10em, etc.). 
    This value sets the ideal size of the item before space distribution.

2. auto(default) value. It means the size of the flex item will be determined by its content, 
    or by its width and height properties if they are set.

Order of Precedence:
---------------------
a. If flex-basis is non auto and width/height are set, flex-basis will take precedence for determining the item's initial size, 
b. if flex-basis is auto, width and height will be used.
 -->

<!-- 
How It Works
------------
flex-basis defines the starting size of a flex item within the flex container.
It acts as the base size from which the item will grow or shrink based on the container's 
available space and the values of flex-grow and flex-shrink.

By default Every flex item have - ( flex-grow: 0 + flex-shrink:1 ) + flex-basis:auto
