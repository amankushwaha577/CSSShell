<!-- 
The flex property in CSS is a shorthand for three individual properties: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. 
It allows you to define how a flex item behaves within a flex container in terms of growing, shrinking, and its initial size. 
This property is essential for creating flexible and responsive layouts using the Flexbox model.

flex: [<flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>];

    1.flex-grow: A number that defines the ability of a flex item to grow relative to the rest of the flex items in the container.
    2.flex-shrink: A number that defines the ability of a flex item to shrink relative to the rest of the flex items in the container.
    3.flex-basis: Defines the initial size of a flex item before space distribution happens (can be a fixed size or auto).

    Default Value ;
    The default value for flex is 0 1 auto, which means:

    1.flex-grow: 0: The item will not grow.
    2.flex-shrink: 1: The item will shrink if needed.
    3.flex-basis: auto: The item will size according to its content.
-->


 <!-- 
 Note: Suppose you created a flex item with flex-basis :500px
 and now you resized your screen upto 300px than it will be the condition of overflow.
 The items may overflow outside the boundaries of the container, which can cause horizontal scrolling or clipping depending on 
 the overflow property of the container (e.g., overflow: hidden, overflow-x: auto, etc.).
