<!-- 
The flex property in CSS is a shorthand for three individual properties: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. 

flex: [<flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>];

1.flex-grow :  The flex-grow property determines how flex items should grow (Relative|Proportially) to other items in main axis,
               when thereâ€™s extra space in the container. 
2.flex-shrink: The flex-shrink determines how a flex item should shrink (Relative|Proportially) to other items in main axis.
               when the *space* is insufficient in the container
    
    
    3.flex-basis: Defines the initial size of a flex item before space distribution happens (can be a fixed size or auto).

    Default Value ;
    The default value for flex is 0 1 auto, which means:

    1.flex-grow: 0:   The item will not grow.
    2.flex-shrink: 1: The item will shrink if needed.
    3.flex-basis: auto: The item will size according to its content.

 <!-- 
 Note: Suppose you created a flex item with flex-basis :500px
 and now you resized your screen upto 300px than it will shrink (if flex-shrink: 1)
