<!-- 
The flex property in CSS is a shorthand for three individual properties: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. 
It allows you to define how a flex item behaves within a flex container in terms of growing, shrinking, and its initial size. 
This property is essential for creating flexible and responsive layouts using the Flexbox model.

flex: [<flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>];

    1.flex-grow: A number that defines the ability of a flex item to grow relative to the rest of the flex items in the container.
    2.flex-shrink: A number that defines the ability of a flex item to shrink relative to the rest of the flex items in the container.
    3.flex-basis: Defines the initial size of a flex item before space distribution happens (can be a fixed size or auto).

    Default Value ;
    The default value for flex is 0 1 auto, which means:

    1.flex-grow: 0: The item will not grow.
    2.flex-shrink: 1: The item will shrink if needed.
    3.flex-basis: auto: The item will size according to its content.

 <!-- 
 Note: Suppose you created a flex item with flex-basis :500px
 and now you resized your screen upto 300px than it will shrink (if flex-shrink: 1)

 doubt chatgpt-
 The items may overflow outside the boundaries of the container, which can cause horizontal scrolling or clipping depending on 
 the overflow property of the container (e.g., overflow: hidden, overflow-x: auto, etc.).
