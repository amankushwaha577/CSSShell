The justify-items property does not apply to flexbox layouts; it is specifically designed for CSS Grid layouts. 
In flexbox, you use justify-content to align flex items along the main axis and align-items for alignment along the cross axis.

For flexbox, the closest equivalent to controlling alignment within individual items is using align-self (for the cross axis).
