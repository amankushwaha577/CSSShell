<!-- 
Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is designed for one-dimensional layouts. 
It allows you to align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic.
 -->

 <!--  flex-direction =>
 The flex-direction property in CSS controls the direction in which flex items are laid out within a flex container. 
 It determines the main axis, which is the primary direction in which flex items flow. By default, 
 items are placed in a row from left to right, but flex-direction allows you to customize
 flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;

1.row (default): Items are placed in a row, flowing from left to right (in a left-to-right layout).
2.row-reverse: Items are placed in a row but in reverse order, flowing from right to left.
3.column: Items are placed in a column, flowing from top to bottom.
4.column-reverse: Items are placed in a column but in reverse order, flowing from bottom to top.
