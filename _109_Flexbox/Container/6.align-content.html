<!-- 
The align-content property in CSS is used to align flex lines within a flex container along the cross axis, 
but only if there is extra space on that axis. 

***This property applies only when there are multiple lines of flex items (e.g., when flex-wrap is set to wrap or wrap-reverse)***. 
It helps control the spacing between and around rows or columns of flex items in a flex container.

align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch;
 -->

 <!-- 
1.flex-start: Lines are packed toward the start of the container’s cross axis.
2.flex-end: Lines are packed toward the end of the container’s cross axis.
3.center: Lines are packed toward the center of the cross axis.
4.space-between: Lines are evenly distributed along the cross axis, with no extra space at the edges.
5.space-around: Lines are evenly distributed with equal space around them, adding extra space on the edges of the container.
6.space-evenly: Lines are distributed with equal space between and around each line, creating balanced spacing within the container.
7.stretch (default): Lines are stretched to fill the container along the cross axis, provided the container has extra space.
